## Documentation for Shiny App: CarPayment Calc

This Shiny App allows you to compute Car Payments. A user enters the final sale price of the automobile (after taxes), and also enters the downpayment that was made to the dealer.  

The user then inputs an interest rate between 1% and 12%, and selects a period over which payments are to be made.  

The App returns the monthly payment over the period selected. The calculations made by the server are as follows:

Amount to be Financed (P) = Total Sale - Downpayment  

I = (Interest Rate / 100) / 12  

N = Period * 12  

Monthly Payment = (P * I) / (1 - (1 + I)^(-N))


Example:  

```{r Calc, echo = TRUE}
totalSale <- 25000
downpayment <- 2000
rate <- 5
period <- 7

P <- totalSale - downpayment
I <- (rate / 100) / 12
N <- period * 12
monthlyPayment <- (P * I) / (1 - (1 + I)^(-N))
monthlyPayment
```
